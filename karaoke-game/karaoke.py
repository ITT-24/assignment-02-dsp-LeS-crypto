"""
- capture microphone audio
- detect sound's major frequency in real time
- create small audio-based game (e.g. karaoke)
"For example, it could be a karaoke
game in which players have to sing a certain (random, pre-defined, or MIDI) me-
lody, or a game to train playing, singing, or whistling musical notes or intervals."

3P - frequency detection works correctly and robustly
2P - playable (fun) game
1P - low latency btw input and detection
